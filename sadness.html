        <div class="flex-item" class="emotion">You may notice a heaviness in your chest or a lump in your throat. You
            might feel tired, both physically and emotionally, and less interested in being around others. Your thoughts
            might be dwelling on things that didn't go well or feelings of loss. You might find it hard to focus or feel
            motivated.

        <div class="flex-item" class="emotion">While it's important to acknowledge and process your feelings, try not to
            dwell in sadness for extended periods. Use this emotion as a signal to reflect on what's truly important to
            you. Engage in self-care activities and reach out to trusted friends or professionals when needed. Remember
            that sadness can enhance empathy and compassion, making you more attuned to others' emotions. Consider
            expressing your feelings through creative outlets like art or writing.
