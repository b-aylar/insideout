            Mental health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being, especially for college students facing a challenge
            to balance social, academic and personal life (and sometimes, sleep). Our quiz is, therefore, designed to
            help you become more aware of your current emotional state and mood. By regularly checking in with yourself,
            you can better understand your feelings and take proactive steps to maintain or improve your mental health.
            In general, increased self-awareness can lead to better stress management, improved academic performance,
            and healthier relationships. Remember, acknowledging your emotions is the first step towards fostering a
            positive mindset and seeking support when needed. Please give your consent to record your personal data.
