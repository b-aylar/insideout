        <div class="flex-item" class="emotion">If you're feeling anxious right now, you might notice your heart racing
            and your breathing becoming shallow. Your mind may be buzzing with worries about the future or replaying
            past events. You might feel tense, restless, or find it hard to concentrate on the present moment. These
            feelings are valid and common.

        <div class="flex-item" class="emotion">Remember, anxiety is manageable. Try taking a few deep, slow breaths to
            calm your body. Ground yourself by focusing on your surroundings or engaging in a simple task. Be kind to
            yourself â€“ anxiety doesn't define you. If these feelings persist or overwhelm you, don't hesitate to reach
            out to a friend, family member, or mental health professional for support. You're not alone in this, and
            there are effective ways to manage anxiety and improve your well-being.
